# Figma Video Cover

Figma Plugin to get the cover of YouTube and Vimeo videos from their urls.

## How it works?

It opens a Figma panel and you insert the YouTube or Vimeo url. If one or more layers are selected, a fill with the video cover image will be added to all of them. If no layer is selected, a new layer will be created with the video cover fill added.
